Through postico I started a new database with the name: 'weekend-to-do-app'
(it was called out in the pool.js document)

I created by table with the following info:
CREATE TABLE "tasks" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "description" text,
    "activetaskstatus" BOOLEAN
);

then I 'seeded' my table with three tasks - with this command set:

INSERT INTO tasks ("description", "activetaskstatus")
VALUES 
('shoot Mariah Cary -metaphorically, not really.', 'TRUE'),
('buy cotton candy', 'TRUE'),
('Crawl that dungeon!', 'TRUE');
